# COD4-Mod-Launcher
A simple program that allows you to start Call of Duty 4 with mods enabled. 
You set your Call of Duty 4 game directory, it lists any mods that might exist in your game's mod folder, 
and then you can launch the game with the selected mod from the list on either Singleplayer or Multiplayer.
